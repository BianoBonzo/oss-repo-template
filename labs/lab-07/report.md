## Checkpoint 2
Find the Nightly and Experimental sections and look at some of the submissions. How can you see what tests were run for a particular submission?

+ If you click on the build name of a build, you can then scroll all the way down and click on "View Tests Summary" to see what tests were run on a specific submission. You can click on each test to see details of the process of running the test. 

Find a submission with errors. Can you see what the error condition was? How does this help you debug the failure?

+ When I was looking at the dashboard, I couldn't find any submissions with errors. To see what the error condition was, after clicking on the build name, you would scroll down and click on "View Errors Summary". You can debug failures easily because after clicking on an error, the website tells you where the error occurred. 

Find a system that is close to your specific configuration in the Nightly, Nightly Expected or one of the Masters sections. How clean is the dashboard? Are there any errors that you need to be concerned with?

+ The system that most closely matches my specific configuration is *cmake-windows_vs2022_x64*. It's quite clean, as there are no errors and all tests passed.
