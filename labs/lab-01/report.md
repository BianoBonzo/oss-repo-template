# Reading Reflections

1. The 4th criteria of Open Source Definition was what interested me the most. I didn't know that developers of open source software were permitted the use of modified source code. I wonder if this criteria is mainly for open source developers who are protective of their work and don't want others to see the exact blueprints of their work. Furthermore, I'm curious how exactly licenses can break the 5th criteria. The entire purpose of open source software is that it's entirely for the public to use. It's hypocritical that a developer would restrict access to their code for certain groups of people. 
2. After reading the article, I think the tips for asking questions in a smart and refined manner can apply very easily to all fields. The advice seem very practical in the professional world when you need to ask coworkers or your boss questions. I've never thought about how you have to essentially show users of coding forums your competence, effort, and passion for whatever you are working on. There must be many questions posted on forums where the users didn't think about how open ended their question was, such as "How do you do this procedure exactly?" Receiving answers from hackers is a free service, but the price is putting time into asking your question. 
3. Another suggestion I'd add is to redirect the task to another person that you believe is more beneficial and knowledgeable. If you think you can't provide the best answer, but you are more confident that another person you know can, there's nothing wrong with redirecting the question to that person. Furthermore, another suggestion would be to include learning material if you can. If you want the user to learn rather than just take your direct answer, you can give them reading material or a resource that contains a clear answer to their question. 
4. This anecdote demonstrates the dangers of utilizing open source technologies. Jesse's engine was a modification of the Microsoft file-sharing system. Copyright has always been a massive problem in the music industry. Perhaps the RIAA's ruthlessness of the lawsuit was due to Jesse's search engine being comparable to a big corporation's own technology. The chapter did not mention anything about licences or whether Jesse credited Microsoft in his work. This shows that open source programs that facilitates piracy of media, especially music, can become very dangerous territory. It's important for developers to thoroughly think about the consequences to making their work open source. In the wrong hands, even if it's due to an unforeseen accident, open source software could potentially ruin lives if they are not handled with care.
