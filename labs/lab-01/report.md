# Reading Reflections

1. The 4th criteria of Open Source Definition was what interested me the most. I didn't know that developers of open source software were permitted the use of modified source code. I wonder if this criteria is mainly for open source developers who are protective of their work and don't want others to see the exact blueprints of their work. Furthermore, I'm curious how exactly licenses can break the 5th criteria. The entire purpose of open source software is that it's entirely for the public to use. It's hypocritical that a developer would restrict access to their code for certain groups of people. 
2. After reading the article, I think the tips for asking questions in a smart and refined manner can apply very easily to all fields. The advice seem very practical in the professional world when you need to ask coworkers or your boss questions. I've never thought about how you have to essentially show users of coding forums your competence, effort, and passion for whatever you are working on. There must be many questions posted on forums where the users didn't think about how open ended their question was, such as "How do you do this procedure exactly?" Receiving answers from hackers is a free service, but the price is putting time into asking your question. 
3. Another suggestion I'd add is to redirect the task to another person that you believe is more beneficial and knowledgeable. If you think you can't provide the best answer, but you are more confident that another person you know can, there's nothing wrong with redirecting the question to that person. Furthermore, another suggestion would be to include learning material if you can. If you want the user to learn rather than just take your direct answer, you can give them reading material or a resource that contains a clear answer to their question. 
4. This chapter further cements the point that the holy grail of any programming problem is to solve it as simple but elegant as possible. It's important for us to thoroughly understand the algorithms and symbols we are looking at. The quote that stuck out to me the most is that "'writing' a program to be displayed in public involves much more than
typing symbols." For instance, if the source code of an open source project is too long and complex, it will lead to developers using the code solely for the fact that it works, rather than understanding and appreciating why it works. I've never seen a quicksort algorithm analyzed at such a deep level. Jon Bentley emphasizes the importance of recognizing clutter and actively avoiding them when developing software. Developers need to strive to create work that is exceptional and separated to consumers, similar to how a sign of good acting is that viewers don't even notice them. While I do prefer other algorithms besides quick sort, I do see the hidden beauty behind Jon Bentley's 12 lines of code.
