## Why is it important to choose a license? 
A license must be chosen in order to differentiate whether a piece of software is free or nonfree. The license must show any newcoming users the limitations and rules of whatever they want to do with the software. Examination of the license can tell you whether the software is truly free or not, depending on how strict the conditions of the license are. 

## Why is it important that you shouldn't use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
Licenses are mainly based off of copyright or contracts. You could get in trouble with the law depending on what type of work you do with the project, and the lack of a license won't help your case. Furthermore, a project with no license means you would have to reach out to the developers themselves and ask them which actions are permissable if you want to do something meaningful with the software.  

## Failure to follow the Open System Model Section
I think that it's better to release software early in the process. By making your project open-source early on, you could discover a productive and friendly community that will greatly benefit the development cycle later on. By taking in ideas and examining various possible improvements from a variety of developers, you could gain insights that you never would have if you kept the software development solely to yourself. 

## License Justification (#6)
Linux uses the [GPLv2 license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_2) because its distribution, which includes the Linux kernel and many supporting libraries, were provided by the [GNU Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project). The GNU Project was an endeavor by [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) to give developers the freedom and ability to run, copy, study, and modify software. He started the project in 1983, and his achievements practically pioneered the term "free software". His goal was to create a a free software system compatabile with Unix. To achive it, he started a free software movement by starting the [Free Software Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation) and writing the [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License). The conditions of the license reflected Stallman's beliefs of the 4 major software development freedoms: run, study, modify, copy. Although there is a third version of GPL, Linux is still licensed under the second version because the new version prohibits the use of Linux in digital rights management. Furthermore, there are now thousands of copyright holders to the license, so it would be a major challenge to obtain permission from all of them.
