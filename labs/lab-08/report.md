## Checkpoint 1

## Checkpoint 2
1. If you click on the build name of a build, you can then scroll all the way down and click on "View Tests Summary" to see what tests were run on a specific submission 
2. There are no submissions with any errors. 
3. The system that most closely matches my specific configuration is *cmake-windows_vs2022_x64*. It's quite clean, as there are no errors and all tests passed.
